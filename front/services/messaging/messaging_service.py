"""Send and receive the admin messaging's emails.

Four flows feed the same Conversation, which is the source of truth:

  - the contact form, recorded on the spot and mirrored to the contact mailbox;
  - a send from /messaging, mailed to the correspondent through SES;
  - a mail received on the contact address, handed over by Mailgun's inbound route;
  - a mail sent from the contact mailbox, reported by Mailgun's event webhook.

Everything we mail to the contact address goes out from no-reply@, which is precisely what the
inbound webhook filters on so our own mirrors never come back in as new messages.
